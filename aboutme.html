      About Me
    </h1>

    <p>
      My name is Mary-Emma Barnhill and I'm a third-year computer science student at Carleton University. I'm interested in human-computer interaction, web development and the intersection of computer science and writing. I've previously worked in roles with Nokia and ADGA involving frontend development and router testing. When I'm not programming, I enjoy reading and listening to music.
